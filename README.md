<div align="center">
  
## ✨Explanation
This repository contains the following.
This open-source project aims to compare images of people wearing masks and those without masks on GitHub. The code utilizes a Haar Cascade file for face detection, performing facial detection on input images. The facial regions are then adjusted to a fixed size, providing the option to resize them as desired, and the results are displayed.

## ✨Results
The script will process the images, detect faces, and save the results in the specified output directory. Adjust the face region size and customize the resizing options according to your requirements.

Feel free to contribute and improve the project!
